# Shallow

![Check us out!]()

Shallow is a web-based application capable of distinguishing between authentic and face-swapped videos. Developed using VGG16, a Keras convolutional neural network specializing in photo-recognition, Shallow uses React.js and Tensorflow.js.

## Why we made Shallow

In 2017, fake celebrity pornographic videos called Deep Fakes surfaced, creating scandals for all involved and opening the door to what is actually possible to fake. Since it's introduction, the technology behind DeepFakes has been used in politics as well as "revenge porn". As it currently stands, only the quality of the video is able to distinguish the authenticity, and that will disappear as the process is refined.

Our goal with this project was to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of distinguishing between real and faked videos in order to protect the reputation and integrity of anyone who could be affected by faked videos.
